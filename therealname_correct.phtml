<p>The <a title="Mimosa hostilis" href="https://www.mimosacompany.com"><em>Mimosa hostilis</em></a> tree grows in as many places in the Americas as the variety of names it has received. Throughout history, botanists have given it many different scientific names. In the communities where it grows, people call it by its use. In addition, it has been documented that some of these common names are used generically or to refer to different plants.</p>
<p>In Brazil it is known as "jurema", but this is also the name of almost 20 other species&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">1</span></a></em>.In Mexico it is known as "tepezcohuite", but the origin of the word is not clear. In the scientific world, it has received more than ten names, but only six have been accepted&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">2</span></a></em>. Not to mention some common names such as "charcoal" or "skin tree" (from “carbon” and “arbol de la piel” in Spanish).</p>
<p id="history-of-its-scientific-name">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The history of its scientific name</h2>
<p>The scientific names of the species serve to identify them among themselves and avoid ambiguity. This is useful for glimpsing their evolutionary history. It begins by specifying the basics: is it an animal or a plant? Until each descriptive level makes it clear that we are talking about a single species.</p>
<p style="margin: 0;">The full scientific description is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kingdom: Plantae</li>
    <li>Phylum or division: Tracheophyta</li>
    <li>Class: Magnoliopsida</li>
    <li>Order: Fabales</li>
    <li>Family: Leguminosae (or Fabaceae)</li>
    <li>Genus: Mimosa</li>
    <li>Species: Mimosa tenuiflora</li>
</ul>
<p>And, until today, the most accepted scientific name is <a title="Mimosa tenuiflora" href="https://www.mimosacompany.com"><strong><em>Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd] Poir</em></strong></a> (although it is also found as <em>Poiret). </em></p>
<p>Getting to that name required many years of discussion and comparison of plant descriptions made by explorers, doctors, botanists, among others.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <p>To begin with, there is a long debate in the world about the genus of the <em>Mimosas</em> and <em>Acacias, </em>especially in Africa and Australia <em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">3</span></a></em>. Mimosas are associated with invasive behaviour while acacias are associated with decorative uses, although that behaviour depends more on the region to which they belong and their popular names (there are acacias that are popularly called mimosas). In cultural terms, this contrast is important for reasons of historical identity to adopt them as national symbols. For example, in Australia, the genus Acacia is considered almost a national symbol, in its forests they are second only to the eucalyptus. In Africa, especially South Africa, the relationship with the acacias is also strong, as they are part of the landscape. However, there have been conflicts when it has been proposed that some Australian varieties without spines, which are invasive in South Africa, should be of the genus Acacia while, at the same time, it has been proposed to change the genus of the typical African flat-crowned acacias to Vachellia or Senegalia. The differences between the two are not easy to distinguish. Both genuses belong to the family <em>Leguminosae</em> (or <em>Fabaceae<strong>)</strong></em> which is characterised by shrubs with fruits in the form of legumes or pods, making them cousins of beans (porotos) and peas. The flowers are the main way to differentiate them: the genus <em>acacia </em>always has more than ten stamens <em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">4</span></a></em>.</p>
        <p>The name of the <em>Mimosas</em> comes from the Latin <em>mimus,</em> "mime or actor" and from the Greek <em>mimos </em>"imitator, mimic". The name <em>Acacias</em> derives from the Greek <em>akakia,</em> "point, thorn, sharp point" and the first record we have of this name to describe plants comes from the first-century compilation <em>"Of medical matter" <strong>(</strong>Peri Ylis latrikis,</em> in Greek) made by the Greek physician Dioscorides&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">5</span></a></em>.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>The discussion between <em>mimosas</em> and <em>acacias</em> permeated the names that would be assigned to the <em>Mimosa tenuiflora. </em>So much so that the first botanist to describe it, the German Carl Ludwig Willdenow, called it <em>Acacia tenuiflora</em> from Venezuela in 1806. But a few years later, in 1810, French botanist Jean Louis Marie Poiret transferred this species to the genus <em>Mimosa. </em>Thus, the name of the <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em> tree contains "Willd" (for Willdenow) and "Poir" (for Poiret), in reference to the first botanists who described it&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">6</span></a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nineteenth century was characterised by a boom in explorers, mainly Europeans, who travelled the world with the intention of generating scientific knowledge. So, only a few years after Willdenow and Poiret had proposed a name, other botanists found the same plant in different regions of the American continent.</p>
<p>The German Hermann Karsten (in botany his abbreviation is H. Karst) described the <em>Mimosa cabrera </em>in Colombia in 1863. Then, in 1901, the Swiss Jacques Huber, described the <em>Mimosa nigra</em> in Brazil. Both described the same species, but in different regions. Thus, only at the beginning of the 20th century, the following names already existed: <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em> (Willdenow) Poiret, <em>Acacia tenuiflora</em> Willdenow, Mimosa <em>cabrera</em> Karsten, and <em>Mimosa nigra</em> Huber&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">7</span></a></em>.</p>
<p>In 1846&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">8</span></a></em>, the British George Bentham identified a species he called <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em> Benth, but it turned out to be another plant so the name was changed to <em>Mimosa zimapanensis</em> Britton. In historical searches, attention should be paid to the full name of the species to avoid confusion, although in current records the only <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em> is the Willd. Poir.</p>
<p>However, that's not the whole story. Where did, for example, its most popular synonym, <em><a title="Mimosa hostilis" href="https://www.mimosacompany.com/">Mimosa hostilis</a>, </em>come from?</p>
<p>Bentham proposed the name <em>Mimosa hostilis</em> Benth in 1875&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">9</span></a></em> in <em>Transactions of the Linnean Society of London&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">10</span></a></em>.</em> A year later, in 1876, the German physician and botanist Carl Friedrich Phillip von Martius mentions it in volume XV of <em>Flora Brasiliensis&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">11</span></a></em>.</em> This extensive compilation, which was written over the decades, is the result of expeditions through Brazil. There, Martius makes a detailed description and proposes to call it <em>Acacia hostilis</em> Mart ... returning to the discussion about its belonging to the genus <em>Acacia</em> or <em>Mimosa. </em>Hence the agreed name was <em>Mimosa hostilis</em> (C. Mart) Benth.</p>
<p>In botany, the accepted name is considered to be the oldest, so <a title="Mimosa tenuiflora" href="https://www.mimosacompany.com"><em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em></a> would be the right one. However, <em>Mimosa hostilis is</em> still very popular, especially in Brazil, and is considered an accepted synonym in botany lists.</p>
<p>But the discussion doesn't stop there. On the list of <em>World Flora Online,</em> a global effort devised in the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) to collect information on all known plants, the following names are recognised as accepted scientific names <em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">12</span></a></em>:</p>
<ul style="padding: 0;">
    <li style="list-style: none;">Acacia hostilis Mart.</li>

    <li style="list-style: none;">Mimosa limana Rizzini.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a compilation published in 2012 <em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">13</span></a></em> on nomenclatures of medicinal and poisonous plant use, lists these names that have also been used as synonyms at some point in history, including some of those mentioned above:</p>

</ul>
<p>Despite the long history of its name, it seems that the greatest scientific consensus is to use <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em> and <em>Mimosa hostilis,</em> but let us not forget that it could be mentioned in other documents under other names, especially those published before the 21st century.</p>
<p id="the-skin-tree-in-mexico">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tepezcohuite: the skin tree in Mexico</h2>
<p>The <a title="Mimosa tenuiflora" href="https://www.mimosacompany.com/"><em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em></a> tree is well known in Mexico as tepezcohuite (also written as tepescohuite or tepexcohuite). The meaning of this word is not entirely clear and there are various sources and interpretations, although they agree that it has its roots in the Nahuatl language, the original language of the Aztecs.</p>
<p>One of the most cited records of the word comes from the <em>Dictionary of Aztequisms&nbsp;</em><em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">14</span></a></em>, a book published in 1912 which sought to bring together words of Nahuatl origin used in Mexico at that time. In this book we find the words "tepecuitazote", defined as a medicinal plant, and "tepehuiscle", described as a hard tree. In no definition is there any reference that gives clues to know which one refers to the <em>Mimosa hostilis. </em></p>
<p>Researchers have found a direct relationship of the word Nahuatl with the species, which dates back to 1922 <em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">15</span></a></em>. The American botanist Paul Carpenter Standley compiled in <em>Trees and Shrubs of Mexico </em>almost two thousand pages of tree and shrub species from Mexican territory with their common and scientific names. There he mentions "tepescahuite" (p. 360) as the common name of the <em>Mimosa cabrera</em> Karst which, we know, is another name given to it in 1863. In fact, it does mention a <em>Mimosa tenuiflora </em>Benth (p. 363) but refers to what would later be called <em>Mimosa </em><em>zimapanensis.</em></p>
<p>However, there are more records of similar names. Mexican researcher Sara Camargo-Ricalde reviewed them and found, moreover:</p>
<ul style="padding: 0;">
    <li style="list-style: none;">Tepescohuite, mentioned in publications of 1976 and 1991.</li>
    <li style="list-style: none;">Tepesquehuite, a name frequently given in Oaxaca, southern Mexico.</li>
    <li style="list-style: none;">Tepexohuitztli, a Nahuatl word quoted in 1987.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common to find claims that the tepezcohuite tree is mentioned, and described, in the Codex <em>Libellus of medicinalibus indorum herbis</em><strong><em>,</em></strong> but the researcher mentions that no reference to it appears. In the digital version of this document from 1552, also known as the Codex Cruz-Badiano, which compiles hundreds of plants from the colonial period, we also find no reference to the tepezcohuite tree.</p>
<p>A possible origin of the word was described in 1975. According to Camargo, it refers to the Nahuatl words "tepetl" (hill) and "cuahuitl" (tree): <em>tree of the hill</em>. In fact, the Aztec Dictionary mentions both words as well.</p>
<p>Another origin cited by Camargo was described in 1986, in which it is suggested that "tepus- cuahuitl" comes from the sum of "tepustli" (iron or metal) and "cuahuitl" (tree): <em>iron tree</em>, alluding to the hardness of its wood. It resembles the word "teposkuouit", from a variant of Nahuatl known as nahuat spoken in the mountains of Puebla, a few hours from the capital of Mexico. In the dictionary of that region "teposkuouit" is described as "<em>tree strong as steel&nbsp;</em><em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">16</span></a></em> and is formed from the sum of the words "tepos" (steel) and "kuouit" (tree, wood or log).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional herbalists in Mexico refer to <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em> simply as "skin tree" although they have no etymological origin that refers to skin. This is normal, as it relates to its use. In the <em>Dictionary of Mexicanisms&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">17</span></a></em>,</em> tepezcohuite is described as "a medicinal tree, whose bark is used as an analgesic, fungicide, repairer, and stimulant for the regeneration of the dermis", the most popular use in this country.</p>

        <p id="jurema-a-sacred-plant">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Jurema: a sacred plant of the Brazilian caatinga</h2>
        <p>The jurema is popular in the traditions of the tribes of northeastern Brazil and among groups of African descent. Since the Portuguese colonization, the Indians shared their knowledge with communities descended from slaves, who still use it to treat infections, inflammations and in religious ceremonies&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">18</span></a></em>.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, the word jurema or yurema is used to refer to the <em>Mimosa tenuiflora </em>tree. However, they do not always refer to this plant. Almost twenty species have been identified that are popularly called "jurema". To distinguish it from jureminha or <a href="https://www.mimosacompany.com/mimosa-hostilis-rootbark.html#gs.kq49hs">jurema</a>-branca it is called jurema-preta, but even so, that name refers to three more species: <em>Mimosa acutistipula </em>Benth., <em>Mimosa ophtalmocentra </em>Mart. Ex Benth., and <em>Piptadenia moniliformis</em> Benth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Several researchers have found that another common name in Brazil for jurema is "calumbi"<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">19</span></a></em>, a common word in the ecosystem called caatinga. The caatinga is considered the largest tropical dry forest ecosystem in South America. But, as with jurema, calumbi is used for several species such as <em>Senegalia bahiensis</em> (Benth.) Seigler &amp; Ebinger&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">20</span></a></em>, the <em>Piptadenia stipulacea </em>(Benth.) Ducke&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">21</span></a></em> and the <em>Mimosa arenosa </em>(Willd.) Poir&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">22</span></a></em> – all of them very similar, visually speaking, to <em>Mimosa hostilis </em>and called jurema-branca.</p>
        <p>Jurema is a main ingredient in preparations used by indigenous and Afro-Brazilian groups for religious purposes. In the Kariri-Xoko tribe, for example, only those considered "initiated" can scrape the <a href="https://www.mimosacompany.com/mimosa-hostilis-rootbark.html#gs.kqa289">root bark of the <em>Mimosa tenuiflora</em></a> obeying the strictest rules of the ritual. <a title="Mimosa hostilis root bark" href="https://www.mimosacompany.com/mimosa-hostilis-rootbark.html">The Mimosa hostilis root bark</a> is boiled to a thick, dark substance. With tobacco and candles, these rituals are practiced during the Toré festival where mythical entities and ancestors are worshipped. The consumption of the drink, mixed with other ingredients, can cause anxiety, dizziness, changes in vision, tingling, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">23</span></a></em>. This substance is also sacred to religions born from syncretism in the north of Brazil, such as <em>Santo Daime and </em><em>União do Vegetal&nbsp;</em><em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">24</span></a></em>, in neo-chamanic currents and other religions installed in more urban areas such as <em>Catimbó and Umbanda</em>.<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">25</span></a></em></p>
        <p id="its-other-names">&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Its other names</h2>
        <p>While, in Mexico, the most frequent use of tepezcohuite is medicinal and cosmetic and, in Brazil, is used for sacred and healing ceremonies; its use in Central America is not so specific and is reduced to serve as firewood.</p>
        <p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, it is known as "black coal" (from “carbon negro” in Spanish)&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">26</span></a></em>. In Honduras, Venezuela, and Colombia, it is called "carbonal", "cabrera" or "cabrero" and “carbón colorado"&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">27</span></a></em>. These names are so common that it is very difficult to find specific references to <em>Mimosa tenuiflora. </em></p>
        <p>Peasant groups have made efforts to document their uses of <em>Mimosa hostilis. </em>In Mexico, some communities have listed uses other than medicinal: from the use as live fences, firewood, charcoal, and even leather tanning&nbsp;<em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">28</span></a></em>. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) <em><a href="#refone"><span style="font-size: x-small;">29</span></a></em> recognises that the charcoal produced from <a href="https://www.mimosacompany.com/mimosa-hostilis-rootbark.html#gs.kqev0w">jurema</a> wood is one of the most caloric and preferred in the area.</p>
